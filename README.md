## How to get up and runing

- Clone the app.
- Add new file to the `Constants` folder with a `Keys.swift` name, The content of the file should be your `apiKey`
as a `UInt8` array as below:

``` Swift
import Foundation

enum Keys {

  ///
  /// Open weather API key as `[UInt8]`.
  ///
  static let apiKey: [UInt8] = []

}

```

To generate this key, use the `Obfuscator` class.

``` Swift
print(Obfuscator.obfuscate("your_key", Constants.strings.key))
```

Take the array printed and replace it with your apiKey value.

``` Swift
import Foundation

enum Keys {

  ///
  /// Open weather API key as `[UInt8]`.
  ///
  static let apiKey: [UInt8] = [28, 64, 89, 15, 4, etc...]

}

```
